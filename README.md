Brief
I wanted to create an app that would allow users to track their carbon footprint over time. I had originally wanted to use an API to suggest volunteering opportunities for the user to offset their footprint but after a lot of research i found there wasn’t a suitable API for this so instead i decided to display environemntal news gatherered through an API on my homepage.
